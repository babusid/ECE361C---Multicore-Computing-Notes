This repository serves as a copy of my personal notes in the form of an Obsidian Vault for ECE361C - Multicore Computing, as taught by Professor Vijay Garg at UT Austin in Spring 2024. Feel free to contact me at sidharth.n.babu@utexas.edu if you have any questions, but there is no guarantee I respond. If you would like to contribute additional insights or new notes, simply fork this repository, and open a pull request!
